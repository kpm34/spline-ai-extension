# UI Improvements - Chrome Extension

## Recent Fixes

### 1. ✅ Fixed Side Panel Overlapping

**Problem:** Side panels were positioned with `position: fixed` and overlapped with each other when opened.

**Solution:** Changed side panels to `position: absolute` within the main overlay, so they move together as a unit.

**Changes:**
- Side panels now positioned relative to main overlay (`right: 100%`)
- Added `margin-right: 10px` for spacing
- Side panel content uses smooth `transform` animation
- Everything moves together when dragging

### 2. ✅ Improved Drag Functionality

**Problem:** Dragging was subtle and not obvious where to grab.

**Solution:** Enhanced drag handle visibility and improved drag mechanics.

**Improvements:**
- Drag handle now has background color (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`)
- Hover effect scales up and brightens
- Active (grabbing) state shows visual feedback
- Entire header is draggable (not just the handle)
- Added `.dragging` class for smooth movement
- Better visual feedback with glowing shadow during drag
- Improved viewport bounds checking

### 3. ✅ Better Visual Feedback

**Changes:**
- Drag dots are larger and more visible (18px, white with shadow)
- Hover shows transform scale (1.05x)
- Active shows pressed state (0.98x)
- Cursor changes: `grab` → `grabbing`
- Shadow intensifies during drag: `0 16px 64px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.6)`
- Transitions disabled during drag for smoothness

## How to Use

### Dragging the Overlay
1. **Hover** over the header area - you'll see the grab cursor
2. **Click and hold** on the drag handle (⋮⋮) or anywhere on the header
3. **Drag** to reposition - the side panels move with it
4. **Release** to drop in new position

### Using Side Panels
1. **Click** on a side tab (💎, 📦, 📝, 🎯, ✨)
2. Panel **slides out** from the left
3. Fill in context information
4. **Click ✓ Apply Context** or click the tab again to close

## Technical Details

### CSS Structure
```
.spline-cli-overlay (fixed, draggable)
├── .overlay-header (drag area)
│   └── .drag-handle (visual indicator)
├── .overlay-body (content)
└── .side-panels (absolute, moves with parent)
    ├── .side-tabs (icon buttons)
    └── .side-panel-content (slides in/out)
```

### Positioning
- **Main overlay**: `position: fixed` (draggable)
- **Side panels**: `position: absolute` (relative to main overlay)
- **Side content**: `transform: translateX()` (smooth animation)

### Drag Mechanics
- Uses mouse events: `onmousedown`, `onmousemove`, `onmouseup`
- Calculates delta position: `pos1`, `pos2`, `pos3`, `pos4`
- Bounds checking keeps overlay partially visible
- Excludes buttons from drag initiation

## Known Behaviors

### Expected:
- ✅ Side panels move with main overlay
- ✅ Smooth drag without jank
- ✅ Visual feedback on all interactions
- ✅ Cannot drag by clicking buttons
- ✅ Overlay stays within viewport bounds

### By Design:
- Overlay can be dragged partially off-screen (50px minimum visible)
- Position resets when extension is reloaded
- Only one side panel can be open at a time

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
- [ ] Remember overlay position (localStorage)
- [ ] Snap to edges
- [ ] Resize overlay by dragging corners
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for moving overlay
- [ ] Double-click header to reset position
- [ ] Minimize to floating button
